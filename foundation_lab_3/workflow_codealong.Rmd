## What is R Markdown?

## 1. Introduction

Let's get familiar with the R Markdown layout and syntax.
    
### 1.1 YAML Heading

Yaml is not a markup language. It contains, title, author, dates, type of document etc. YAML is picky!

Check out this site on[Yaml heading](https://zsmith27.github.io/rmarkdown_crash-course/lesson-4-yaml-headers.html) by @Smith.

### 1.2 R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, webpage and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> or [The R Markdown: the definitive guide] (https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can also press `ctrl`+`shift`+`k`

### 1.2a. Markdown Syntax

R Markdowns syntax is based off of [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html).
